                        <p> The current shortage is mainly a result of the leaving of experienced pilots, which also affects
                            the amount of people being trained to become teachers in order to help increase the number of new 
                            pilots. This also leads to an increase in people wanting to fly for big
                            companies as they eventually leave the Air Force and look for work elsewhere. There will likely be 
                            an increase in
                            certified flight instructors to compensate for the increased demand for new pilots in the Air
                            Force. Because of this, the shortage will decrease over time and will lead to a
                            significant increase in newer pilots leading to a decrease in the number of people flying for the
                            Air Force, but leading to generally positive long term effects for the industry as a whole. What 
                            this means is that although the numbers for USAF are
                            low as of now, it doesn't mean that the industry as a whole is the same.

                        <p>This means that with the
                            increased demand for competent pilots flying for the military, there will likely be a generally
                            beneficial outcome for most branches in aviation since the USAF will increase its production of
                            ready pilots while as a result also increasing the number of pilots flying commercially. Another
                            reason why these efforts will likely prove beneficial and ultimately useful is within their goal in
                            the number of pilots produced per year. The article says that “The Air Force has established a
                            goal of increasing production from 1,200 to 1,600 pilots per year, and additional students will
                            necessitate a corresponding increase of instructors to train them.” (Ewing 24) The author uses
                            this help illustrate the point that the USAF has increased their target amount in order to combat
                            the shortage which relates back to the main point because their focus on increasing their target
                            amount shows that the number of pilots likely won't go down anytime soon and the increased
                            demand from the USAF as well as other airlines will likely cause wages to go up as a result in
                            order to retain pilots as long as possible.</p>
