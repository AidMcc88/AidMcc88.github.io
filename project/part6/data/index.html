                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>The first reason as to why the aviation industry will likely experience growth within the
                        future despite the current shortage is through the Air Force's efforts in increasing the amount of
                        readily available teachers for new pilots. The pilot shortage will lead to a projected increase in 
                        the number of flight instructors due to the fall off in the number of experienced pilots and the increase in the amount of new people interested in
                        flying. Because of this, the amount of pilots flying for the Air Force as of now might be below
                        what is necessary, but the numbers will likely increase in the near future as the Air Force will
                        likely hire more undergraduate pilot training instructors to compensate for the inability to retain
                        experienced pilots. This should help remedy the issue of not being able to retain their best pilots
                        by increasing the number of new pilots.</p>
