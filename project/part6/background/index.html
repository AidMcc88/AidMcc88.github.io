                    <h3>My Interest</h3>
                    <p>I've been interested in aviation in general for a long time. My dad is a commercial pilot, so growing up I heard about and 
                        experienced a lot of aviation related events. I went to a lot of air shows with my dad and enjoyed them a lot, and over time
                        my enjoyment of flying grew further and further. When I was 17 I flew an airplane for the first time and worked towards getting
                        my private pilot's license. As my enjoyment grew I also began to wonder what the job market was like. Especially since my dad
                        was in the field, I wanted to learn more about what it was like being a pilot for hire. This evolved to my curiosity of the
                        extent to which major airline companies demanded more experienced pilots.</p>
