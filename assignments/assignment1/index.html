        The solar system facinates me as it has existed for centuries but only now do we know of it's contents.
        It consists of the sun and all the celestial objects that orbit it, which includes not just the planets,
        but also the moons, asteroids, and comets. For a long time, people thought that each of the different 
        planets, including the sun, revoled around Earth, but it does not. Studying the solar system helps us
        understand the vastness of space and our place in it.

        Our solar system is located in the galaxy known as the Milky Way. It is home to eight major planets,
        including Earth, which is the only known planet to support life. It also includes 7 other planets,
        including Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto used to also be considered
        a planet, but lost it's status in 2006.

        <li>There are currently eight planets in the Milky Way solar system.</li>
        <li>The sun is at the center of them all, where the planets all orbit around it.</li>
        <li>Moons orbit planets, similarly to how planets orbit the sun, and help humans better understand celestial bodies.</li>
