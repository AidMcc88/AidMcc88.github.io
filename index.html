                    <p>
                        Many reptile owners in the pet industry receive inaccurate and misleading information in regards to their pet reptileâ€™s nutritional needs. This is quite dangerous in the long run and results in a wide variety of health problems including exponentially reduced life spans. Our solution should be something that contains a comprehensive list of feeder insects/animals, and their nutritional profiles to greatly reduce the confusion, and filter out the misinformation. The end result being healthier pet reptiles.
